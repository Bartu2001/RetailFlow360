🏢 RetailFlow360: A Realistic Case Study of Modern Data Engineering on GCP
📍 Business Context
A large retail chain is struggling to unify its operational data. Each day, stores across the country generate massive volumes of data, but that data is:

Spread across multiple systems (sales, campaigns, sensors)

Stored in various formats (CSV, relational databases, object storage)

Not integrated for centralized analytics

Underutilized due to a lack of automation and cloud-based infrastructure

🎯 Business Needs
The company's data team is tasked with:

Unifying all datasets into a central data warehouse (BigQuery)

Combining batch and streaming data in a single workflow

Automating the process from ingestion to transformation and visualization

Presenting actionable insights via business dashboards
